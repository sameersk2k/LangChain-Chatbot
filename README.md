# Brief explanation of how RAG works

![DBBLOG-3334-image001](https://github.com/sameersk2k/LangChain-Chatbot/assets/115322069/5a05aebd-c900-4146-b954-1d8e30c68fef)

A RAG bot, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation bot, enhances the capabilities of our LLM by incorporating additional information provided in the prompt. Initially, we vectorize the text we intend to use as "augmented knowledge" and compare it with the prompt. The system identifies the most relevant text based on similarity scores and uses it to enrich the conversation. This selected text acts as a prefix, providing context and guiding the responses generated by our LLM.
We have used chroma as our vector storage and OpenAI for embedding our text chunks into vectors.
